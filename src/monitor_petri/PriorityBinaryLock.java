/**
 * A lock with two priority levels.
 * There is only one permit available, thus the 'binary' in the class' name.
 * Each lock() blocks if necessary until the lock is available, and then takes it.
 * Each unlock() releases the lock, potentially waking a blocking acquirer.
 * 
 * The special feature in this lock is that a {@link #lock(LockPriority)} call may be with high or low priority,
 * and a {@link #unlock()} call prioritizes a high priority caller.
 * That is, a thread sleeping with high priority will be released before a low priority one.
 * 
 * Among threads of the same priority level, the lock's queue behaves as a FIFO queue.
 *
